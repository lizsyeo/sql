# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. 📚

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```

Type 1: Overwrite
In the type 1 architecture, only the most recent address is retained. The customer table and customer_address table would have a 1-1 relationship as each customer would be associated with 1 address. From a privacy perspective, this might be more beneficial as it does not retain historical data, hence reduces the amount of privacy concerns. For a bookstore, it makes sense to implement the Type 1 architecture as we are only interested in the customer's current address.

Type 2: Retain changes
In the type 2 architecture, historical address are retained. The customer table and customer_address table would have a 1 to many relationship. This means that as time goes by, more customer data is stored. From a privacy perspective, it increases the risk of potential data breaches as more data is stored over time. It might be beneficial if we need to conduct audit on the historical data. In the case of a bookstore, it is less likely that an audit of historical customer address is required.

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
1. It is more complex and contains more schemas. For example, under the 'Sales' schema, it contains a 'SalesReason' table.

2. It contains the dbo information such as ErrorLog table, AWBuildVersion table and DatabaseLog table.
